# UIToolkit
UI utility useful when required to show UI components in terminal based  application.
  
e.g. we write window/UI less program that does something like periodically ping some server, now when server is not reachable it should show error message. Now for terminal based application to show error means print it on console that means you have to run JAR for this application from terminal to see error message which is not appropriate as just to see some rare case error message we keep a terminal window open. So now we may think of implementing UI based application and this is also somewhat not appropriate as to write all boiler plate code of initializing Stage, Scene etc. just to show some error message which may or may not happen. So in such scenario when we do not need UI but for some rare corner cases where we may need to alert user or ask user input with bare minimum UI components without having any UI window implementation I find this toolkit suitable to use.
