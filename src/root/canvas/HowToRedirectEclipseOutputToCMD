Step 1) Run Java program as usual (it does not matter if it fails), and switch to the debug view.

Step 2) Right click on the process, and open the property window by selecting "Properties".

Step 3) Select and copy the command-line parameter used to launch the program.

Step 4) Hit the arrow-button next to "External Tools" (The play icon with a small red toolbox), and hit "External Tools Configuration"

Step 5) Create a new configuration, with the following data:
		
Location: The path to the cmd.exe of your Windows
		  For Example: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
		
Working Directory: e.g. D:\LeisureCoding\bin
		
Arguments: "/c start C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k " followed by the previously copied command.
For Example: /c start C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_92\bin\java.exe" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath D:\LeisureCoding\bin StickMan
	
Please note, that you need to wrap paths containing whitespace with quotes (“).
	
The above command will start your application in a new, detached console window, which will stay open until you manually close it.
Now you can launch your newly created configuration and enjoy your application from inside Eclipse.
